# trouy.dev

A personal landing page and blog.

Built using Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView.

## TODO

- Implement an easier way to create blog posts (currently manually sending to DB) as well as a way to better display them.
- Add an interesting, real-time feature that can show the unique capabilities of LiveView.
